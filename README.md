CS320 Software Testing Projects and Artifacts

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

Test early and test often is a good motto to have when it comes to making sure that code, program, and software functional requirements are met. Being detailed oriented, and anticipating as many possible outcomes that may arise from the written code is helpful to uncover any bugs.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

The best way to interpret user needs is through effective communication during the planning phase, particularly the requirements gathering stage, of the software development life-cycle. Once the best understanding of the requirements has been gathered, it is then critical to make sure that proper testing is conducted. Several testing methods, such as unit testing, intergration testing, and user testing, are all good measures to ensure great code quality. 

**How do I approach designing software?**

Designing software always begins with a good initiation phase to determine what is being built and why it is being built, at a high level. This will help in the second phase, which will be the planning phase, in determing how to go about doing so, and how long it will take. Good planning and efficient requirements gathering are key steps in a good software design.
